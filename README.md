# Bachelor Thesis
In this repository are saved the main artifacts of my bachelor thesis. The 
title of the thesis is "Heterogenous Graph Neural Networks for Action 
Prediction on Egocentric Action Scene Graphs". As the title says, the main 
focus of this work was to experiment with Heterogenous GNN, a particular 
type of GNNs capable of handling heterogenous graphs, to perform action 
prediction on EASG, a novel form of representation of egocentric videos.

## Artifacts
The three documents present in this repository are:
1. The actual thesis in pdf.
2. The slides used to present this work to the University Commition.
3. The notebook containing the code used to perform such experiments.

The notebook is also accompanied by the annotation files used. The files 
containing the additional features are available in the EASG main repo.
